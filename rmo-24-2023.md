**Subject:**  
Prescribing the Revised Policies and Procedures Relative to the Accreditation of Cash Register Machines (CRIMs), Point-of-Sale (POS) and Other Similar Sales Machines/Software Generating Invoices/Receipts Including Electronic Invoicing or Electronic Receipting System/Software Used under a Subscription-Based Agreement

**To:**  
Assistant Commissioner - Large Taxpayers Service, All Regional Directors, R

## OBJECTIVES

In order to align the provisions of Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 49-2019 (Decentralization on the Accreditation of Cash Register Machines (CRMs), Point-of-Sale (POS), Sales Receipting Software, and Other Sales Machines Generating Invoices/Receipts at the National Office, Revenue Regions and Revenue District Offices Level) with the requirements of RMC No. 68-2015, and to amend a portion of Revenue Memorandum Order (RMO) No. 10-2005, this Order is hereby issued to:

1. Provide the updated policies and procedures relative to the Accreditation of Cash Register Machines (CRMs), Point-of-Sale (POS), Sales Receipting Software, and Other Sales Machines Generating Invoices/Receipts, including Electronic Invoicing (e-Invoicing) or Electronic Receipting (e-Receipting) System/Software used under a Subscription-Based Agreement (hereby collectively known as "Sales Machines/Software");

2. Reiterate the decentralization of the accreditation process and granting of the Large Taxpayers Accreditation Board (LTAB) and Regional Accreditation Board (RAB) the authority to approve/deny such accreditation, with the National Accreditation Board (NAB) acting as a policy-making body;

3. Provide a standard format for system-generated invoices/receipts, X-Reading, Z-Reading, Backend Reports, and other reports, including the generation of Audit Journal or Electronic Journal (e-Journal) to be generated from "Sales Machines/Software";

4. Streamline the documentary requirements and set the standard time for the processing of Applications for Accreditation of "Sales Machines/Software" to comply with the "Ease of Doing Business and Efficient Government Service Delivery Act of 2018" (Republic Act [RA] No. 11032).

## II. DEFINITION OF TERMS

1. **Accreditation** - a process of evaluating whether or not "Sales Machines/Software" are compliant with the BIR's invoicing/receipting requirements.

2. **Accreditation Number (AN)** - a unique system control number generated through the Enhanced Electronic Accreditation and Registration (eAccReg) System that shall be reflected on the Certificate of Accreditation.

3. **Application Service Provider (ASP)** - provides applications and related services over the Internet. Business establishments rent/lease/subscribe to ASP software for a fee. The software is accessed remotely through a web browser and not installed on a company's local drive. A multi-tenant version of this model is commonly known as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).

4. **Audit Journal** - refers to the duplicate copy of the tape invoices/receipts generated from the CRM.

5. **Backend Reports** - reports to be generated from the "Sales Machines/Software" or its main/central server. This may be named differently depending upon the taxpayer/developer of the "Sales Machines/Software" (such as but not limited to BIR Sales Summary Report, Daily Cash Report, Terminal Accountability Report, Detailed Sales Report, Senior Citizen Sales Book/Report, Persons with Disability Sales Book/Report, National Athletes and Coaches Sales Book/Report, Solo Parent Sales Book/Report, Void Report, Sales Return and/or Refund Reports, etc.).

6. **Cash Register Machine (CRM)** - a type of business machine that has a memory and can record the sale/transfer of merchandise or services rendered. It generates tape invoices/receipts which are issued in lieu of manual invoices/receipts. It usually has a drawer for storing cash and other valuables and is equipped with two (2) rollers or its equivalent that can generate two (2) tape invoices/receipts - one tape for audit and tax purposes and the other tape to be given to the customer. The tape shows sequentially numbered invoices/receipts and details of transactions per invoice/receipt issued.

7. **EIS Unique ID** - a unique series that would serve as a reference number in transmitting sales data to the BIR.

8. **Electronic Journal (e-Journal)** - similar to the Audit Journal of CRM, which shall be generated using the POS software to reflect the copy of all principal, supplementary invoices/receipts, and adjustment documents (such as but not limited to return, void, cancellation, and refund), "X-Reading" (or Cashier's Accountability Report/End-of-Shift Report) and "Z-Reading" (or End-of-Day/EOD Report) that are dispensed by such "Sales Machines/Software". Such e-Journal must reflect similar information as presented on the original invoices/receipts issued to clients/customers/buyers and adjustments/reports printed that shall be saved on a daily basis in a single ".txt" file format or as a standard text document. The e-Journal is not the same as the Electronic Sales (eSales) Report or Electronic Sales Journal/Book being required by the BIR based on existing revenue issuances.

9. **Machine Identification Number (MIN)** - a unique number issued to CRM/POS upon registration in the Enhanced eAccReg System. It is an identification (ID) of the CRM/POS that will report its sales in the Electronic Sales (eSales) Reporting System.

10. **Point-of-Sale (POS) System** - a type of sales receipting system that is considered more complex than a Cash Register Machine, which may have the capability to record and track customer orders, process debit and credit card accounts, link to other systems in the establishment's network, and manage inventory. Similarly, this system can record the sale/transfer of merchandise or services rendered with system-generated invoices/receipts. The POS may be categorized as follows:
    a. **Bundled POS Hardware and Software** - type of POS software which is tied-up with a specific machine brand and cannot be sold/used separately by the supplier/vendor/developer/manufacturer/pseudo-supplier.
    b. **Customized POS Software** - POS software that is tailor-made based on the business requirements of the company.

11. **POS System Set-Up/Architecture** - the conceptual model that will define the structure and behavior of the system, which may be stand-alone, POS connected to server consolidator, server-based - decentralized or global.

12. **Pseudo-supplier** - taxpayer-user of "Sales Machines/Software" who are either of the following:
    a. Direct Importer or local distributor of "Sales Machines/Software" similar sales machines/software generating invoices/receipts.
    b. Taxpayer-user who developed their own "Sales Machines/Software" or a local buyer of customized "Sales Machines/Software" for their own internal use and/or for distribution to their branches, franchises and/or related companies.

13. **Registration** - a process of securing a Permit to Use Sales Machine, Special Purpose Machine and/or receipting or invoicing system/software.

14. **Reset Counter** - refers to a counter that advances by 1 every time the maximum accumulated sales capacity or the maximum serial number/series of invoices/receipts is exhausted or fully utilized. Resetting of the accumulated sales is either manually triggered or automatic.

15. **Sales API Portal** - a developer console/platform that allows Application Service Providers (ASPs) and partners to configure their integration of the Application Programming Interface (API) and test the correctness of their sales data transmission.

16. **Sales Machines/Software Generating Invoices/Receipts** - machines/software other than CRM/POS and Component of CAS that is capable of generating sales and reports.

17. **Special Purpose Machine/Software (SPM)** - a machine/software designed/developed to support sales and accounting activity which may generate or issue transaction documents except principal invoices/receipts. This may also include machine/software functioning as ordering machines of online platforms located in the place of business of partner merchants/stores/restaurants. SPM is only subject to registration but not accreditation.

18. **Subscription-Based Agreement** - an agreement where recurring fees are being paid by clients/customers, typically on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.

19. **Web-based POS** - a type of POS that can be accessed through a web or portal.

20. **X-Reading** - also known as Cashier's Accountability Report/End-of-Shift Report, which shall be generated from the CRM/POS/Other Similar Sales Machine to determine the accountability of the cashier or any authorized personnel at the end of each shift or as may be required by the management depending on the company policy.

21. **Z-Counter** - refers to a counter that advances by 1 and is reflected on the face of the Z-Reading/EOD Report and Backend Reports to determine the number of times the said report was generated. The said counter, however, shall not increase regardless of the number of reprints.

22. **Z-Reading** - also known as End-of-Day (EOD) Report, which shall be generated from the CRM/POS/Other Similar Sales Machine to determine the total sales for the day and other important details as may be required by the BIR, including the Accumulated Grand Total Sales (previous day and present day), Breakdown of Sales (i.e., VATable Sales, VAT Exempt Sales, Zero-Rated Sales, and VAT Amount) and Modes of Payment (i.e., Cash, Credit Card, Gift Checks, etc.), Z-counter, Reset Counter, if any, details of adjustments to sales like Void, Return, Refund transactions, and many others.

2. All suppliers/vendors/developers/providers/taxpayer-users who intend to distribute/sell/use "Sales Machines/Software" shall apply for enrollment in the Enhanced eAccReg System by submitting a Sworn Declaration (Annex "A") to the LT Office/RDO where such supplier/vendor/developer/provider/taxpayer-user is registered.

   > Note: Attach Special Power of Attorney (SPA) (for Individual) or Board Resolution indicating the purpose and the name of the authorized representative or Secretary’s Certificate (for non-individual), and any government-issued ID of the authorized representative, if transacting through a Representative.

   Upon receipt via email of the approval of their enrollment in Enhanced eAccReg System, such suppliers/vendors/developers/providers/taxpayer-users shall apply for accreditation by accomplishing online the Application for Accreditation in the Enhanced eAccReg System and manually submitting all the documents listed under the Checklist of Documentary Requirements (Annex "B") to the RDO where the supplier/vendor/developer/provider/taxpayer-user's Head Office is registered.

   The "Sales Machines/Software" subject for evaluation and inspection by the BIR must comply with the specifications/features stated in Section IV (5) of this Order to qualify for the accreditation. The aforesaid specifications/features must be explicitly attested and declared by the taxpayer through a duly signed and notarized Sworn Statement (Annex "C").

3. A "pseudo" supplier (as defined under Section II (12) of this Order) of "Sales Machines/Software" shall likewise apply for accreditation of its machines/software.

4. The concerned Technical Working Group (TWG) shall evaluate the "Sales Machines/Software" on its compliance with the applicable specifications/features stated below to qualify for the accreditation through a system demonstration by the taxpayer-applicant. The schedule of the demo shall be coordinated with the taxpayer-applicant by the TWG Secretariat within three (3) working days upon receipt of complete documentary requirements or depending on the preparedness of the taxpayer-applicant to present the "Sales Machines/Software" to the TWG Members based on a "FIRST-IN, FIRST OUT" policy. Meeting/evaluation may be done via any online platform depending on the situation.

5. The "Sales Machines/Software" shall comply with the following specifications/features, which must be indicated in the submitted notarized Sworn Statement, to wit:

   - a. **Accumulated Grand Total Sales**. The Accumulated Grand Total Sales must have at least twelve (12) digits inclusive of the two (2) decimal places. However, the physical limitation of the maximum number of digits must be taken into consideration or the accumulated grand total sales must not be truncated if the Z-Reading/EOD Report shall be printed on a standard tape receipt paper. Sales machines must be equipped with a reset counter that advances by one (1) every time the Accumulated Grand Total Sales is fully utilized or exhausted and the same shall be shown on the Z-Reading/EOD Report. Such counter shall be reset to zero (0) upon retirement/cancellation of Permit to Use (PTU) of "Sales Machines/Software".

     In case of resetting, the concerned RDO shall be notified about it to ensure that all the sales data registered in the machine up to the last day it was used are properly recorded. A letter notification must be submitted to the RDO not later than three (3) days after the reset is done with attached printed Z-Reading or EOD Report as of the day of resetting to validate that the reset counter incremented by one (1).

     Failure to notify within the prescribed period shall be subject to a penalty of One Thousand Pesos (₱1,000) per letter notification not submitted, provided that the aggregate amount for a calendar year shall not exceed Twenty-Five Thousand Pesos (₱25,000), pursuant to the provisions of Section 250 of the NIRC of 1997.

   - b. **Tamper-free**. In order to protect the integrity of the data, the sales data must not be capable of being manipulated. The "Sales Machines/Software" must not be switchable to "Training Mode", "No Sale Transaction Mode" or any other manipulations that will impair/impede/suspend the recording of sales upon deployment of the same for use in business operations.

     All machines that will be exclusively used for training purposes and will generate documents during training must not be considered as invoices/receipts. Hence, the statement "THIS IS NOT A SALES INVOICE/OFFICIAL RECEIPT. PLEASE REQUEST FROM SELLER YOUR SALES INVOICE/OFFICIAL RECEIPT." must be boldly printed on the tape receipt that will be generated.

   - c. **Activity Log or Transaction Log**. The "Sales Machines/Software" must have the functionality to generate a report that shows the record of all actions done (such as extract, push or pull, edit, delete, etc.); who created the transactions (with root/administrator's account, including activities performed in case the software provider/developer accesses and manipulates the software remotely); the values involved in the activity; and date and time of transactions.

   - d. **Non-volatile memory**. The "Sales Machines/Software" must have the capability to retain sales data and other important information when the power is turned off or must be equipped with a recovery or backup system to retain the said data/information for the period prescribed under Revenue Regulations No. 5-2014.

   - e. **E-journal or Audit Journal**.

     - **For CRM**: This type of sales machine must be equipped with two (2) rollers—generating one copy for the audit journal tape intended for audit and internal revenue tax purposes and the other copy to be issued to the customers as invoice/receipt. There must be a safety mechanism installed that will prevent the operation of the machine if only one of the rollers will be used.
     - **For POS**: This type of sales machine must have the capability to generate an Electronic Journal (e-Journal) which was defined under Section II (8) of this Order.

   - f. **Sales Readings**. The most common Sales Readings are the "X-Reading" and "Z-Reading" (see Section II (20) and (22) hereof for definitions). The "Sales Machines/Software" must be able to generate a report from the sales machine or central server showing the reading of daily sales, sales discounts, sales adjustments such as refunds, returns, canceled, void, etc., and accumulated grand total sales recorded therein, such as "X-Reading" (Annex "D-1") and "Z-Reading" (Annex "D-2").

     It should be noted that the "Z-Reading" must cover all transactions for the whole sales operation or business day. Thus, sales transactions or adjustments reflecting the same sales operation date after the "Z-Reading" was generated must not be allowed, whether the day ends at 11:59 PM or otherwise as set by the establishment's business set-up requirement.

     Such readings generated from "Sales Machines/Software" must be capable of being reprinted any time or as may be required for audit, post-evaluation, and/or Tax Compliance Verification Drive (TCVD) purposes.

     e-Invoicing or e-Receipting System/Software used under a Subscription-Based Agreement, which will be transmitting sales data to the BIR, shall not need X-Reading, Z-Reading, or its equivalent.

   - g. **Backend Reports**. The "Sales Machines/Software" must be capable of generating a report summarizing all sales transactions showing separately the VATable Sales, VAT Exempt Sales, and Zero-Rated Sales, such as BIR Sales Summary Report (Annex "E-1") and other system-generated backend reports, such as but not limited to the Senior Citizen Sales Book/Report (Annex "E-2"), Persons with Disability Sales Book/Report (Annex "E-3"), National Athletes and Coaches Sales Book/Report (Annex "E-4"), Solo Parent Sales Book/Report (Annex "E-5"), and Void Report.

     No manual Sales Book, except for CRM, shall be required since "Sales Machines/Software" must be capable of generating and printing the abovementioned reports any time or as may be required for audit, post-evaluation, and/or TCVD purposes.

     > Note: In any case that a CRM-generated/POS-generated receipts or invoices were replaced by manual receipts or invoices, the sum of all the system-generated receipts or invoices that were converted to manual receipts or invoices shall be reflected as a deduction or adjustment in the CRM Sales Book or Backend Report pursuant to RR No. 16-2018.

   - h. **Sequential series of accountable forms/documents**. The invoices/receipts generated from the "Sales Machines/Software" must have a minimum of six (6)-digit running Serial Number (SN).

     The maximum number of the running SN must be taken into consideration and the same must not be truncated when the invoices/receipts are printed. The SN must also be padded with zero (0) or the leading zeroes must be shown.

     > e.g., If the 103rd invoice/receipt will be generated from the "Sales Machines/Software", it should be displayed as "000103" instead of "103" only [assuming that the maximum number of digits is six (6)].

     The "Sales Machines/Software" may also be equipped with a Reset Counter that advances by one (1) every time the maximum number of digits is fully exhausted or utilized. The said Reset Counter is appended to the SN of the invoices/receipts as prefix/suffix.

     > e.g., "00-000001" shall be shown on the face of the invoice/receipt where the first two digits – "00" is the Reset Counter as prefix of the six-digit running SN.

     In order to maintain the consecutive sequence of the transaction numbers imprinted on the invoices/receipts and the audit journal/e-Journal, the invoice/receipt numbering mechanism of a sales machine shall not be disturbed or tampered with.

   - i. **Reprint Functionality**. "Sales Machines/Software" with functionality to reprint principal invoices/receipts shall not distort the stored sales data and must indicate the word "REPRINT" on the face of such invoices/receipts, including the date and time of printing was done.

   - j. **"Push" Functionality**. All sales data or information (as required under the e-Invoicing/e-Receipting Project of the BIR) that will be generated from an "Sales Machines/Software", if applicable, must be able to send or push to the BIR on a "real-time" or "near real-time" the EIS e-Invoice JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) File Format for CRM/POS based on the provisions of the applicable e-Invoicing/e-Receipting revenue issuances.

   - k. **Verification or Validation Seal**. Serves as a security feature that will determine the authenticity of the e-Invoices/e-Receipts. This functionality must be inherent in all e-Invoices or e-Receipts generated from "Sales Machines/Software" used under a Subscription-Based Agreement. Most common verification or validation seals are Quick Response (QR) Codes, Bar Codes, Uniform Resource Locator (URL) and any other form of seal or security features.

   - l. **Data Retention**. All relevant sales data or information and other accounting records must be retained for a period in accordance with the existing revenue issuance on preservation of records. The said accounting records must be maintained or accessed at the registered place of business or the registered address where the "Sales Machines/Software" is being used.
