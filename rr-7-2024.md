### SECTION 8. Transitory Provisions

1. Certificate of Registration (COR) reflecting the Registration Fee – Business taxpayers are not required to replace its existing BIR Certificate of Registration that includes Registration Fee. The COR shall retain its validity although the Registration Fee is shown therein, and taxpayers are no longer required to pay the Annual Registration Fee. Updating the COR is only necessary if there are changes to the registration information, excluding the Registration Fee, reflected on the COR.

2. Unused Official Receipts –

   - 2.1 Taxpayer to continue the use of remaining Official Receipts as supplementary document. -- All unused or unissued Official Receipts may still be used as supplementary document until fully consumed, provided that the phrase “THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT VALID FOR CLAIM OF INPUT TAX.” is stamped on the face of the document upon effectivity date of these Regulations. The Official Receipt, along with other equivalent documents such as Collection Receipt, Acknowledgement Receipt and Payment Receipt are all the same, serve as proof of payment that cash has been received or that payment has been collected/made for goods and/or services.

   - 2.2 Taxpayer to convert and use the remaining Official Receipts as Invoice. – For ease of doing business, taxpayers shall be allowed to strikethrough the word “Official Receipt” on the face of the manual and loose leaf printed receipt and stamp “Invoice”, “Cash Invoice”, “Charge Invoice”, “Credit Invoice”, “Billing Invoice”, “Service Invoice”, or any name describing the transaction, and to be issued as primary invoice to its buyer/purchaser until December 31, 2024. These documents shall be valid for claim of input tax by the buyer/purchaser for the period issued from January 22 to December 31, 2024, provided that the invoice to be issued bears the stamped “Invoice” and contains information required under Section 6(B) of these Regulations. The converted Invoice as defined in Section 2 hereof can serve as proof of sales transaction and proof of payment at the same time. Any Official Receipts, whether stamped with “Invoice” or unstamped, issued after December 31, 2024, will be considered supplementary documents as provided in Section 8(2.1) of hereof and ineligible for input tax claims.

   The stamping of official receipts as invoices by taxpayers does not require approval from any Revenue District Offices/LT Offices/LT Divisions but must comply with Section 8(2.3) hereof. Taxpayers should obtain newly printed invoices with an Authority to Print (ATP) before fully using or consuming the converted Official Receipts or before December 31, 2024, whichever comes first.

   2.3 Reportorial Requirement of Unused Official Receipts to be Used as Invoice Upon Effectivity of these Regulations – All unused manual and loose leaf Official Receipts to be converted as Invoice shall be reported by submitting an inventory of unused official receipts, indicating the number of booklets and corresponding serial numbers within thirty (30) days upon effectivity of these Regulations, to the RDO/LT Office/LT Division where the Head Office or Branch Office is registered, in duplicate original copies. The receiving Branch RDO shall transmit the Original copy to the Head Office RDO and retain the duplicate copy.

3. Cash Register Machines (CRM) and Point-of-Sales (POS) Machines and E-receipting or Electronic Invoicing Software – Taxpayers using CRM/POS/E-receipting/E-invoicing may change the word “Official Receipt (OR)” to “Invoice”, “Cash Invoice”, “Charge Invoice”, “Credit Invoice”, “Billing Invoice”, “Service Invoice”, or any name describing the transaction, without the need to notify the Revenue District Office(s) having jurisdiction over the place of business of such sales machines, since the reconfiguration shall be considered as minor system enhancement which shall not require the reaccreditation of sales software/system on the part of the software supplier nor the reissuance of the Permit to Use on the part of the taxpayer-user. Provided further, that the serial number of the renamed Invoice shall start by continuing the last series of the previously approved Official Receipt and shall submit notice, indicating the starting serial number of the converted Invoice, to the RDO/LT Office/LT Division where the machines are registered, in duplicate original copies. The receiving Branch RDO shall transmit the duplicate copy to the Head Office RDO.

Taxpayers that are using duly registered Computerized Accounting System (CAS) or Computerized Books of Accounts (CBA) with Accounting Records need to revisit their system to comply with the provisions of the EOPT Act. Since the system reconfiguration will have a direct effect on the financial aspect, it shall be considered as major enhancement which will require taxpayer to update their system registration following the existing policies and procedures of filing a new application. The previously issued Acknowledgement Certificate (AC) or Permit to Use shall be surrendered to the RDO where the concerned taxpayer is registered, and a new AC shall be issued to the Head Office/Branch(es). The required Annex of the AC shall indicate all the branches (if applicable) that are using the said system/software and the sets of series of accountable forms (Invoice) to be used by each of the branches, if applicable.

In order to provide ample time in reconfiguring machines and systems, adjustments shall be undertaken on or before June 30, 2024. Any extension due to enhancements of system shall seek approval from the concerned Regional Director or Assistant Commissioner of the Large Taxpayers Service which shall not be longer than six (6) months from the effectivity of these Regulations.

Documents issued by CRM/POS, e-receipting or electronic invoicing software containing the word “Official Receipt” beginning the effectivity of these Regulations shall not be considered as valid for claim of input tax by the buyer/purchaser.

Issuance of “Official Receipt” for the sale of goods or services after June 30, 2024 will not be considered as evidence of sales of goods or services and shall be tantamount to failure to issue or non-issuance of Invoice required under Section 6(A) hereof subject to penalty of not less than One Thousand Pesos (Php 1,000.00) but not more than Fifty Thousand Pesos (Php 50,000.00) and suffer imprisonment of not less than two (2) years but not more than four (4) years pursuant to Section 264(a) of the Tax Code.
